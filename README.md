<p> My first full-stack capstone project for the Springboard Career Track </p>

<p><b>Goal:</b> The website will allow users to create their own HIIT (high-intensity interval training) workout from a template. They will have options for the structure of the workout (AMRAP, RFT, EMOM) and access to a database of different workouts and their descriptions. Users can search the database by type of workout or muscle group targeted. Users can perform their workout with this screen up and the website will show descriptions/pictures of the specific exercises of the workout as well as an appropriate timer. Logged-in users will be able to save their workouts to be reused and can keep track of the workout results over time. </p>

This appp will make use of the [wger REST API](https://wger.de/en/software/api) for access to workout information and images.
