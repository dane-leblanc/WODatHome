        <h4>AMRAP</h4>
        <p>
          AMRAP is an acronym for "As Many Rounds as Possible". They involve
          doing as many repetitions of a series of exercises as possible during
          a set amount of time. You will need to build multiple stages with the
          same number of different exercises in each stage. You can also
          customize the amount of rest you get between stages. Be sure to log
          how many rounds you were able to get through for each stage (be sure
          to include how many reps you made it into your final round).
        </p>
        <h4>EMOM</h4>
        <p>
          EMOM is an acronym for "Every Minute On the Minute". These workouts
          challenge you to complete an exercise for a certain number of reps in
          less than 60 seconds. Any remaining will serve as recovery time before
          you move on to the next exercise. If you select fewer exercises than
          there are minutes in your workout, the exercises will just cycle back
          from the beginning until your time is up.
        </p>
        <h4>RFT</h4>
        <p>
          RFT is an acronym for "Rounds For Time". This workout asks you to
          complete a specified number of rounds of a set of exercises as quickly
          as possible. Keep track of how quickly you can get through and try to
          beat your highest logged time!
